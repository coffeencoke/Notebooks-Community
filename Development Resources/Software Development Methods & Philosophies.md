# Thesis Statement

- There are many methods and philosophies that describe how a team or organization should develop software.
- Teams adopt these methods and philosophies inherently or without intentional thought. Which leads them to be suboptimal in their performance.

Produce recommendations on which methods and philosophies should be used with each team and product type; c.) Describe any methods and philosophies that work best together; and d.) Describe any methods and philosophies that work against each other.
