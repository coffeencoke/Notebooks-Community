# SDE Interviewing Resources

## General Overview

A lot of the resources I've used in the past are included in the [Coding
Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
github repo. This repo has a lot to offer for prepping for interviews, or just
learning more about technical details of software.

## Algorithms & Data Structures

1. [Big-O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
2. Wikipedia :)
    * [Data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)
    * [Linked data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data_structure)
    * [Sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
    * [Search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_algorithm)
3. Binary Trees
    * Watch some youtube videos
4. Implement them yourself

### Deeper Dive

## Technical Leadership

1. [Effective Technical Leadership](https://medium.com/always-be-coding/effective-technical-leadership-b193a544e771)

## Relevance

Three things of importance worth mentioning:

1. Work with technology that you thoroughly enjoy.
2. Use the right tools for the job.
3. Be aware of the industry standard and emerging technologies available.

Below are resources to help understand which tech I find most enjoyable, a
matrix of tools to help decide what to use for a given use case, and sources to
learn about standard and emerging tech.

### Enjoyable Tech

* [Ruby](https://ruby.github.io/TryRuby/): The most enjoyable languages I've had the pleasure of working with.
* Node: Also a refreshingly fun language to build with.
* VIM: High learning curve, but once you setup [your
dotfiles](https://github.com/coffeencoke/dotfiles) setup right for your
preferences, VIM is very rewarding.
*

## Lanugages

Resources to help learn languages:

- Ruby:
  - [TryRuby](https://ruby.github.io/TryRuby/)
  - [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)
- More TK
