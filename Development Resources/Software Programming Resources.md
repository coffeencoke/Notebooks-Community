# Software Programming Resources

Feel free to share resources you are learning from with me, I am eager to learn
of new sources of inspiration and knowledge.

- [Interviewing Resources](interviewing-resources)

## Learning

* [Grow With Google](https://grow.google/)
* [20 TED Talks on Programming Everyone Must Watch](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ted-talks-programming/)

## Good Reads

1. [The Tao of Programming](http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html): Love this.
2. [Why's (Poignant) Guide To Ruby](http://poignant.guide/): Love this too.
2. [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/): I sometimes resonate more with craftsman than I do with engineers.
3. [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/): It amazes me how many people claim to know "Agile", but have never actually read this.
4. [Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html): The often ignored sub-page.
5. [lowlevelprogramming-university](https://github.com/gurugio/lowlevelprogramming-university)

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is one of the most rewarding learning methods I've experienced.
Because of this, I've listed a few pair programming resources below. If you've
never pair programmed, you should give it a try!

* [Pair With Me](http://pair-with-me.herokuapp.com/) - An app to connect people
with pair programming interests.

Tools for pair programming:

- [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/?origin=c9io) collaborative IDE
- VIM with TMUX
- Video chat such as Google Hangout, Slack, Hipchat, etc.

Jeff Dickey from Heroku wrote a great article about [How to Pair
Program](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/how-to-pair-program-d6741077e513). I
strongly encourage reading this before pair programming yourself, even if you
have plenty of pair programming experience, it's a very good refresher.
