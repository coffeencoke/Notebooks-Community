# Software Programming Resources

## Interviewing Resources

A lot of the resources I've used in the past are included in the [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) github repo. This repo has a lot to offer for prepping for interviews, or just learning more about technical details of software.

## Good Reads

1. [The Tao of Programming](http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html): Love this.
2. [Why's (Poignant) Guide To Ruby](http://poignant.guide/): Love this too.
2. [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/): I sometimes resonate more with craftsman than I do with engineers.
3. [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/): It amazes me how many people claim to know "Agile", but have never actually read this.
4. [Principles behind the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html): The often ignored sub-page.
5. [lowlevelprogramming-university](https://github.com/gurugio/lowlevelprogramming-university)
