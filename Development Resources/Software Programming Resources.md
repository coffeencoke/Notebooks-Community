## Pair Programming

Pair programming is one of the most rewarding learning methods I've experienced.
Because of this, I've listed a few pair programming resources below. If you've
never pair programmed, you should give it a try!

* [Pair With Me](http://pair-with-me.herokuapp.com/) - An app to connect people
with pair programming interests.

Tools for pair programming:

- [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/?origin=c9io) collaborative IDE
- VIM with TMUX
- Video chat such as Google Hangout, Slack, Hipchat, etc.

Jeff Dickey from Heroku wrote a great article about [How to Pair
Program](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/how-to-pair-program-d6741077e513). I
strongly encourage reading this before pair programming yourself, even if you
have plenty of pair programming experience, it's a very good refresher.

## Podcasts

* [Greater Than Code](http://www.greaterthancode.com)
* [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues)

## My Languages of Interest

* My primary languages are Ruby, Javascript, and Java.
* Wanting to become proficient in functional programming languages like Go,
  Clojure, and Scala.

## Relevance

Three things of importance worth mentioning:

1. Work with technology that you thoroughly enjoy.
2. Use the right tools for the job.
3. Be aware of industry standards and emerging technologies available.

Below are resources to help understand which tech I find most enjoyable, a
matrix of tools to help decide what to use for a given use case, and sources to
learn about standard and emerging tech.

### Enjoyable Tech

* [Ruby](https://ruby.github.io/TryRuby/): The most enjoyable language I've had the pleasure of working with.
* Node: Also a refreshingly fun language to build with.
* VIM: High learning curve, but once you setup [your
dotfiles](https://github.com/coffeencoke/dotfiles) setup right for your
preferences, VIM is very rewarding.

### Tools Matrix

TK

### Industry Standards & Emergence

* [AWS Tools and SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tools-sdks/) is a
reasonable list of mainstream languages and frameworks.

## Lanugages

Resources to help learn languages:

- Ruby:
  - [TryRuby](https://ruby.github.io/TryRuby/)
  - [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)
- [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
