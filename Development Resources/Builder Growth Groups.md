I want to help others become strong leaders within the organization and the company. To coach passionate and ambitious people. To encourage and help multitudes of people to thrive and grow.

To accomplish this, I am launching a **Builder Growth** group, which goes beyond regular 1:1s..

By meeting in a group setting, you will:

- Gain confidence by seeing that you're not alone.
- Improve your skills by learning from everyone in the session (not just me).
- Increase your community by meeting more people.
- Have an opportunity to help others grow in the group.

# FAQ

## What makes this different than 1:1s?

I find 1:1s to be helpful on a personal level, but can be attained using an adhoc model. Many of the skills we want to build, whether *soft* or technical, can be learnt in a group setting, and will often yield more benefit compared to a 1:1 session.

## How big will the group be?

This greatly depends on how many people are interested, and for how long. Hopefully the members will outgrow the group. Perhaps they will create their own BuilderGrowth group.

I'm a big fan of the Fib sequence, so I think 13 people is the max size for what I want to accomplish.

If the group grows beyond 13, this is an indicator that more leaders and teachers are needed. I will work with my network to find more people to be BuilderGrowth coaches.

## Can I still have 1:1 help?

Through this, if anyone wants to meet for a more private session to dive deeper into a particular topic, let's arrange some time to do that.

## What will I learn?

The topics will be based on what you want to learn. Chances are, there will be several people interested in this same topic. I will

## Do I have to be an SDE to join?

No, if you're a builder, or want to be, this group is for you.
