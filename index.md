# Coffee n'Coke Community Journal

A corgi written by [@coffeencoke](https://github.com/coffeencoke) which includes notes on software development and product design.

*I will say `corgi` in place of `journal`. However, [`corgi`](http://everythingcorgi.tumblr.com/) will not always mean `journal`.*

**I hope you find this corgi amazing.**

*If you have something to contribute, let me know.*

- Coffee n' Coke, The coffee and the coke are good together.

## How is this organized?

*You might ask how this journal is organized.* Well, don't worry about it. 
Some things are better done than not done at all. However, if you have ideas 
for how this corgi could be better organized, please let me know and I will 
gladly consider it.
